*****************Project roadmap[FOR REFERENCE]*****************

*Task1* [Done] Caroline links crawler - 240 links saved in chicago_links.py

*Task2* [Almost done] Laurinda restaurant info crawler - saved in info_0306.csv

        On a specific restaurant page, find the following:
        1. name
        2. zip_code
        3. price_range (some None)
        4. cuisine
        5. num_review
        6. rating (avg)

        Problems to solve:
        1. Sometimes cannot get 240 exact links - use the saved 240 links for now
        2. cralwer info sometime gives None tag; only 185/240

*Task3* [Done] Julie Rent crawler - 

*Task4* [Progress]Final csv

        1. merge csv from task 2 and 3 on zip_code 
        2. include 4 cols: zip_code, restaurant avg price, income, avg rent

*Task5* [Almost done] Michelle Multiple Linear Regression + Plot - code in regression_0310.py

*Task6* [Progress] Text-based interface



Outlier: give special rec on places with less restaurant
if select a zipcode, it's better to open a specific cuisine here
